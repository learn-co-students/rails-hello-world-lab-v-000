Integrate a route for localhost:3000/hello_world.

Create a static controller that inherits from the application controller and contains the hello_world action.
You can have the call to the view file occur using either the implicit or explicit processes.

Create a file in the views directory that will be called by the static controller's hello_world action, and
add the heading <h1>Hello World</h1> to the file. The test is case sensitive, so make sure you enter it
exactly as shown.
